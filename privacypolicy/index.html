                <li>
                    6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO for the processing of personal data which is necessary for the performance of a contract to which - the data subject is a party. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO, insofar as processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our company is subject.

                § 6 <strong> Conditions for the transfer of personal data to third countries</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the course of our business relationships, your personal data may be transferred or disclosed to third party companies. These may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. When transferring your personal data in third countries, we ensure compliance with the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some third countries are certified by the European Commission through so-called adequacy decisions to have a level of data protection that is comparable to the EEA standard. However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible via binding company regulations, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 (1), (2) <a href="https://beck-online.beck.de/?typ=reference&y=100&a=46&g=EWG_DSGVO">46</a> Abs. <a href="https://beck-online.beck.de/?typ=reference&y=100&a=46&g=EWG_DSGVO&x=1">1</a>, <a href="https://beck-online.beck.de/?typ=reference&y=100&a=46&g=EWG_DSGVO&x=2">2</a> lit. c DSGVO in conjunction with appropriate security guarantees, certificates or recognized codes of conduct.

            </ol>
            <p>
                The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to the user's computer. For this purpose, the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session. The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the log files. The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.

                As soon as the aforementioned data is no longer required to display the website, it is deleted. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended. Further storage may take place in individual cases if this is required by law.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of storage of data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage beyond this period is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.
