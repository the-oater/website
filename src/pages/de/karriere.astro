        We develop high-quality appliances for fresh and sustainable on-site food production. Our first product is The Oater Barista – an
        oat drink machine for the foodservice industry. And this is just the beginning. <br />Our vision is to unlock food transparency and
        true sustainability through an experience of freshness by pioneering on-site production of plant-based food, worldwide. At The
        Oater, we believe the future of food production requires us to rethink WHERE, HOW, and WHAT we produce to ensure a better future on
        this planet for all. By localizing production, we make it more transparent with regional ingredients. <br />We enable our customers
        to make their businesses more innovative and transparent, and in the process, bring fresher and more sustainable offerings and
        experiences to their own customers. We are revolutionizing oat drink. Do you want to join?

        we want to grow and create impact - together and sustainably. In a positive and collaborative environment, we support each other to
        think big and deliver quality. We value ownership and fresh perspectives. Our values are at the heart of how we interact with within
        the team and beyond. The Oater provides equal opportunity for all and encourages all nationalities, genders, sexual orientations,
        religious backgrounds, gender identities, and people with disabilities to apply.
