	<ImgTextFull reverse title="Your subscription and delivery" imgUrl="/ingredientmix_pattern.webp">
		As a business, you register on our digital platform. There you specify your weekly oat drink consumption. This is the basis for your subscription. The Oater automatically
		delivers the right amount of our ingredient mix you need – you pay per usage. No more supply shortages and last-minute purchases at the supermarket. And you can always
		adjust the subscription - we know that your consumption is not constant throughout the year.

	<ImgTextFull title="The Oater Barista Machine " imgUrl="/hotel.webp" id="machine">
		The machine is FREE for participating businesses. You only pay for the Oater Mix per liter. We install the machine and regular maintenance is included in our service.

	<ImgTextFull reverse title="Oat drink production" imgUrl="/machine_ingredientmix.jpg">
		To make our oat drink you only need our ingredient pack (the provided Oater Mix and canola oil) and water from the tap. Each business can decide for itself whether a fixed
		water supply or a water tank is more suitable. More information about the ingredient packs can be found here. You can find out how the production works here.

		Oat drink in a carton was yesterday. The Oater machine produces the oat drink of the future. We are rethinking oat drink - with full barista quality and freshness – no
		packaging waste, no added sugar and no tradeoffs.
