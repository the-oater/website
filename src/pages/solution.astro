        As a business, you register on our digital platform. There you specify your weekly oat drink consumption. This
        is the basis for your subscription. The Oater automatically delivers the right amount of our ingredient mix you
        need – you pay per usage. No more supply shortages and last-minute purchases at the supermarket. And you can
        always adjust the subscription - we know that your consumption is not constant throughout the year.

    <ImgTextFull title="The Oater Barista Machine " imgUrl="/hotel.webp" id="machine">
        The machine is FREE for participating businesses. You only pay for the Oater Mix per liter. We install the
        machine and regular maintenance is included in our service.

    <ImgTextFull reverse title="Oat drink production" imgUrl="/machine_ingredientmix.jpg">
        To make our oat drink you only need our ingredient pack (the provided Oater Mix and canola oil) and water from
        the tap. Each business can decide for itself whether a fixed water supply or a water tank is more suitable. More
        information about the ingredient packs can be found here. You can find out how the production works here.

        Oat drink in a carton was yesterday. The Oater machine produces the oat drink of the future. We are rethinking
        oat drink - with full barista quality and freshness – no packaging waste, no added sugar and no tradeoffs.
