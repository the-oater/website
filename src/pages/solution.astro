        As a business, you register on our digital platform. There you specify your weekly oat drink consumption. This is the basis for your
        subscription. The Oater automatically delivers the right amount of our ingredient mix you need – you pay per usage. No more supply
        shortages and last-minute purchases at the supermarket. And you can always adjust the subscription - we know that your consumption
        is not constant throughout the year.

        aus dem Wasserhahn. Jeder Betrieb kann für sich entscheiden, ob eine feste Wasserleitung oder ein Wassertank besser geeignet ist.
