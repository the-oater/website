        Our independent Lifecycle Assessment study has shown that The Oater oat drink emits 0.15kg CO2/L which is already <span
            class="font-semibold">57% less CO2</span
        > equivalents compared to conventional packaged oat drink and 93% less emissions than cow milk. Here are some of the ways we do it:
    </ImgText>
    <ImgText title="Save packaging" imgUrl="/mission.jpg">
        With The Oater, your business can eliminate single-use packaging. Our fresh oat drink doesn't need a carton. Instead, the oat drink
        can be dispensed directly into reusable bottles. We also supply our ingredient mix in reusable containers, which are returned with
        every new delivery.

    <ImgText background="bg-oat-superlight" reverse title="Save emissions " imgUrl="/saveemissions.webp">
        Oat drink is 90% water. Since our machine uses local tap water, only 10% of the weight needs to be transported for every liter
        produced. And less transportation means fewer emissions. And we save even more emissions by sourcing our ingredients regionally and
        building our distribution hub close to our key suppliers.
    </ImgText>
    <ImgText title="Local ingredients and production" imgUrl="/localingredients.webp">
        We only use regional ingredients, such as organic oats from Germany, which allows us to shorten the transport distances of our oat
        drink even more. Also, our machine was fully developed and produced in Germany and does not need long transport routes to your
        counter. By making some adjustments, we are able to reduce our emissions even further to become 79% less polluting than conventional
        oat drink? You want to see for yourself? Download our full sustainability report here, which includes all data from the lifecycle
        assessment.

        In today's world, the terms "sustainable" and "green" are used loosely by many companies. Without numbers, they mean little as any
        company can use them regardless of their environmental impact. This is where Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) comes in. It involves
        analyzing the environmental impact of all stages of a product from production to disposal. LCA allows us to quantify the
        environmental impact at every stage and optimize areas that need improvement. Transparency is important to us, which is why we share
        our environmental footprint.
    </ImgTextFull>
    <ImgTextFull imgUrl="/lca.webp" reverse background="bg-zinc-200" align="lg:text-right">
        The results of the independent LCA are clear: our oat drink creates 0.15kg CO2 equivalents per liter produced. Of this amount, 42
        percent can be attributed to the cultivation of the raw ingredients (oats, canola), 25 percent of emissions to packaging, 24 percent
        to production onsite and 9 percent to transport. This amount is 57 percent lower than conventional packaged oat drink and 93% lower
        than cow milk. But there are still some levers that can help us improve and reach up to 79% less emissions and that is what we are
        working on now. To learn more about our ecological footprint, download our entire sustainability report here.
