		Imagine you could rethink food production without any constraints. What would it look like? What would you produce? How would you produce? Where would you produce? What
		would drive your decisions?<br />
		We believe that bringing food production on-site is the future. Locally produced food is more sustainable but also brings transparency and quality to the ingredient lists. <br
		/>And we started with oat drink. With our The Oater Barista machine we produce the oat drink of the future – locally. Low packaging waste, significantly lower CO2 emissions
		and better quality and taste. No compromises. And we are just getting started. It’s only impossible until it isn’t.

	<ImgText title="Our Story" imgUrl="/founders.jpg" background="bg-zinc-200" reverse id="story">
		Our story begins in 2021 when Sarah, who has lived vegan for 7 years, was bothered by all the packaging waste and the lack of freshness of her oat milk. She tried all
		alternatives to the conventional drink from the carton, but none convinces in taste and foam. Her conclusion: good barista oat drink without packaging waste? There's no
		such thing! As an engineer, she figured that there had to be a better way and got a team together to find a solution.<br /> And now, over a year later, we are proud to say:
		Yes, it can be better! Our oat drink is fresher, cheaper, AND more sustainable than comparable barista drink from the carton.<br /> We are Sarah, Benjamin, Henrik, and Lisa.
		You want to continue writing the story with us? We look forward to meeting you!
