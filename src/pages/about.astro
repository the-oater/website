        Imagine you could rethink food production without any constraints. What would it look like? What would you produce? How would you
        produce? Where would you produce? What would drive your decisions?<br />
        We believe that bringing food production on-site is the future. Locally produced food is more sustainable but also brings transparency
        and quality to the ingredient lists. <br />And we started with oat drink. With our The Oater Barista machine we produce the oat
        drink of the future – locally. Low packaging waste, a lower carbon footprint and organic ingredients. Harmonious taste without compromise.

    <ImgText title="Our Story" imgUrl="/founders.webp" background="bg-zinc-200" reverse id="story">
        Our journey began in 2021 when co-founder Sarah , who has lived vegan for 7 years, was frustrated by all the packaging waste and the lack of freshness of her oat drink. She tried all alternatives to the conventional drink from the carton, but none convinced her in taste and foam. Her conclusion: good barista oat drink without packaging waste? There's no such thing. 
         As an engineer, Sarah knew there had to be a better way. Fast forward nearly two years, and we proudly offer an oat drink that's fresher and more sustainable than carton-bound barista options.<br /> 
        We are Sarah, Benjamin, Henrik, and Lisa. You want to continue writing the story with us? We look forward to meeting you!
